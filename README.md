Structural features of networks and their impact on economic scaling outputs

More than half of the global population is currently urbanized. This rapid  urbanization  expansion  while  apparently  boost  economic growth, negatively affects the ability of cities to keep up with the demands of the growing population, affecting the access to opportunities, infrastructure, and basic services. While urban areas generate more than 75% of global GDP, they  also include over 863 million urban dwellers living in slumsand informal settlements. Empirical studies demonstrated that, when cities scale, lowest incomes grow just linearly or sub-linearly, while highest income grow super linearly. Thus, even when cities get richer when scaling up, income deciles scale differently. This thesis explores empirical heterogeneity within Urban Scaling by characterizing income distributions across US Metropolitan Areas, demonstrating the Matthew Effect across cities of increasing size. We suspect that this behavior is caused by a topological transition of human networks in urban settings, resulting in fractal structures, which precludes the normal flow of information, including economic benefits. Using our empirical model as an comparative analysis, we aim to identify the effect of the structural features in interactive urban networks on the scaling outputs, in order to demonstrate how the topological structure impact the distribution of scaling benefits.
